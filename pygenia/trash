        This method is used to call an event.

        Args:
            trigger (agentspeak.Trigger): Trigger of the event.
            goal_type (agentspeak.GoalType): Type of the event.
            term (agentspeak.Literal): Term of the event.
            calling_intention (agentspeak.runtime.Intention): Intention of the agent.
            delayed (bool, optional): Delayed event. Defaults to False.

        Raises:
            AslError: "expected literal" if the term is not a literal.
            AslError: "expected literal term" if the term is not a literal term.
            AslError: "no applicable plan for" + str(term)" if there is no applicable plan for the term.
            log.error: "expected end of plan" if the plan is not finished. The plan finish with a ".".

        Returns:
            bool: True if the event is called.

        If the event is a belief, we add or remove it.

        If the event is a goal addition, we start the reasoning cycle.

        If the event is a goal deletion, we remove it from the intentions queue.

        If the event is a tellHow addition, we tell the agent how to do it.

        If the event is a tellHow deletion, we remove the tellHow from the agent.

        If the event is a askHow addition, we ask the agent how to do it.
